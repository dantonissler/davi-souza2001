- 👋 Hi, I’m @davi-souza2001
- 👀 I’m interested in programming and I've been looking for the most on current technologies, innovating progressively in each project.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about javascript and its frameworks. Seeking to understand a little more angular and how to make websites and apps responsive and useful, mixing a little back and front end.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on with my projects.
